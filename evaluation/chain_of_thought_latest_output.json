Imagine two mirrors facing each other \u2013 the image repeats again and again. Similarly, recursion repeats a smaller problem until it\u2019s solved.\n\n--- START CHAIN OF THOUGHT ---\nUser Query: Can you explain recursion in simple terms?\nLearner Data: {\"level\": \"beginner\", \"preferred_style\": \"analogy\", \"subject\": \"Computer Science\"}\n--- END ---"
