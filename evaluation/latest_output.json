  "learning_objective": "Understand and apply Newton's Second Law to solve problems involving force, mass, and acceleration.",
  "lesson_summary": "Newton's Second Law explains the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.  It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.  This means a larger force causes greater acceleration, while a larger mass results in smaller acceleration.",
  "key_points": [
    "Force (F) is a push or pull measured in Newtons (N)",
    "Mass (m) is the amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms (kg)",
    "Acceleration (a) is the rate of change of velocity, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²)",
    "Newton's Second Law formula: F = ma"
