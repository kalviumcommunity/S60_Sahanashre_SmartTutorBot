  "lesson_summary": "Newton's Second Law describes the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.  It states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration (F=ma). We'll learn how to use this equation to calculate any of these three variables if we know the other two.",
  "key_points": [
    "Force (F):  A push or pull measured in Newtons (N)",
    "Mass (m): The amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms (kg)",
    "Acceleration (a): The rate of change of velocity, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²)",
    "F = ma:  Force equals mass times acceleration"
