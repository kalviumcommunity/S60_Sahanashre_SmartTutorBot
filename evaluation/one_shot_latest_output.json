  "learning_objective": "Understand and apply Newton's Second Law of Motion (F=ma) to solve problems involving force, mass, and acceleration.",
  "lesson_summary": "Newton's Second Law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration.  This means a larger force causes greater acceleration, and a larger mass requires a larger force for the same acceleration. We'll learn how to use this formula to solve problems involving moving objects.",
  "key_points": [
    "Newton's Second Law: F = ma (Force = mass x acceleration)",
    "Force (F) is measured in Newtons (N)",
    "Mass (m) is measured in kilograms (kg)",
    "Acceleration (a) is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²)",
    "Jargon: Acceleration—the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time."
