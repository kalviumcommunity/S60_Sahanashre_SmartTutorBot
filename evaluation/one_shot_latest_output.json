  "learning_objective": "Understand and apply Newton's Second Law of Motion (F=ma) to solve problems involving force, mass, and acceleration.",
  "lesson_summary": "Newton's Second Law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F=ma).  This means a larger force causes greater acceleration, and a larger mass requires a larger force for the same acceleration. We'll explore how to use this equation in various scenarios.",
  "key_points": [
    "Force (F): A push or pull measured in Newtons (N)",
    "Mass (m): The amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms (kg)",
    "Acceleration (a): The rate of change of velocity, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²)",
    "F = ma:  Force equals mass times acceleration"
