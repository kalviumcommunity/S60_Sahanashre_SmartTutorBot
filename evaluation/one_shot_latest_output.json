  "learning_objective": "Understand and apply Newton's Second Law of Motion (F=ma).",
  "lesson_summary": "Newton's Second Law describes the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.  It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. We'll explore how to calculate force, mass, or acceleration given the other two.",
  "key_points": [
    "Newton's Second Law: F = ma (Force = mass x acceleration)",
    "Force (F) is measured in Newtons (N)",
    "Mass (m) is measured in kilograms (kg)",
    "Acceleration (a) is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²)",
    "Net force: the overall force acting on an object after considering all forces."

        "Rearrange Newton's Second Law: a = F/m",
