  "lesson_summary": "Newton's Second Law describes the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.  It states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration. We'll explore how to calculate force, mass, or acceleration given the other two.",

    "Newton's Second Law: F = ma (Force = mass x acceleration)",
    "Force (F) is measured in Newtons (N)",
    "Mass (m) is measured in kilograms (kg)",
    "Acceleration (a) is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²)",
    "Net force considers all forces acting on an object; if forces are in opposite directions, subtract them."
