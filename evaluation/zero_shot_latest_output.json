  "lesson_summary": "The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.  It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (legs or cathetus). This theorem is useful for calculating distances and lengths in various situations.",
  "key_points": [
    "In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle.",
    "The Pythagorean Theorem is a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.",
    "A right-angled triangle is a triangle with one 90-degree angle."
